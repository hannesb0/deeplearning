\section{Speech Synthesis}
\label{sec:speech}

\subsection{Motivation}

Why speech synthesis is useful?\\What are use cases in daily life?\\Why there is need to further improve this technology?

\subsection{Conventional Approaches}

Brief overview of conventional approaches how to implement speech synthesis, with highlighting advantages and drawbacks.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
	\item concatenative \& unit-selection
	\item formant-based
	\item diphone-based
	\item \ac{SPSS}
	\item etc. ??
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HMM based Speech Synthesis: \ac{SPSS}}

Description of one approach more in detail \cite{zen:statistical}.

\subsection{\ac{SPSS} with Deep Learning Models}

Description of the improvements of the approach in previous subsection by using deep learning models. \\[0.5em]\textbf{!!~Here the focus on this paper is set~!!}

\subsubsection{One possibility for improvement}

Statistical parametric speech synthesis using deep neural networks \cite{zen:deepstatistical}

\subsubsection{Another possibility for improvement}

\textbf{???}\\
The effect of neural networks in statistical parametric speech synthesis \cite{hashimoto:effect}\\
\textbf{???}

\section{Speech Synthesis on Embedded Devices}
\label{sec:embeddedspeech}

\subsection{Motivation}

Why is it important to implement speech synthesis on embedded platform?

\subsection{\ac{HMM}-based Approach}

An example of how speech synthesis can be implemented on embedded platform without deep learning.

\subsection{Deep Learning-based Approach}

An example of how speech synthesis can be implemented on embedded platform WITH deep learning.
