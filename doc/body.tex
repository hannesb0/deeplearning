\section{Conventional Speech Synthesis}
\label{sec:speech}

\subsection{Motivation \& Approaches}
\label{subsec:convenspeech}

\textbf{\color{ACMRed}Something about applications!}

The classic applications of speech synthesis according to [Cam-Seminar] are the following


Accessibility, screenreader\\
Telephone services, dialogue systems\\
Basic (and rather boring) e-Book reader\\
In-car navigation\\
Basic voice communication aids for people with disabilities\\


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
	\item virtual personal assistants
	\item reading aid for visually impaired
	\item Stephen Hawking
	\item public announcements (train stations)
	\item navigation / media systems in cars (handsfree)
	\item man-machine-interface
\end{itemize}

See here: \cite{suendermann:challenges}, \textit{New and emerging applications of speech synthesis}, \url{http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/blog/text-to-speech-online/}, \url{http://www.readspeaker.com/benefits-of-text-to-speech/}\\

According to \cite{X} speech synthesis can be divided into three types: Canned speech, \ac{CTS} and \ac{TTS}. Canned speech more or less is the replay of prerecorded spoken sentences or words with none or very little adjustments. A typical example are the announcements on train stations. Because of the high effort of recording everything (almost) exactly as it is replayed this approach is limited to only a few simple applications. With \ac{CTS} the waveform is generated out of a linguistic description without any information of the respective text. In this way no natural language processing is required, but nevertheless \ac{CTS} nowadays has not made any important impact. The last and most promising type is \ac{TTS}.
