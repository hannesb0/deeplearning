\section{Conventional Speech Synthesis}
\label{sec:speech}

\subsection{Motivation \& Approaches}
\label{subsec:convenspeech}

Why speech synthesis is useful/important?\\What are use cases in daily life?\\Why there is need to further improve this technology?
Brief overview of conventional approaches how to implement speech synthesis, with highlighting advantages and drawbacks.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
	\item concatenative \& unit-selection
	\item formant-based
	\item diphone-based
	\item \ac{SPSS}
	\item etc. ??
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HMM based Speech Synthesis: \ac{SPSS}}
\label{subsec:hmmspeech}

Description of one approach (\ac{SPSS}) more in detail \cite{zen:statistical}.

\section{\ac{SPSS} with Deep Learning Models}
\label{sec:deepspeech}

Description of the improvements of the approach in previous subsection by using deep learning models.

\subsection{General ways for improvement}
\label{subsec:deepeffect}

The effect of neural networks in statistical parametric speech synthesis \cite{hashimoto:effect}

\subsection{One specific approach for improvement}
\label{subsec:deepspss}

Statistical parametric speech synthesis using deep neural networks \cite{zen:deepstatistical}

\section{Speech Synthesis on Embedded Devices}
\label{sec:embeddedspeech}

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motembedded}

Why is it important to implement speech synthesis on embedded platform?\\
What needs to be thought about when dealing with embedded or mobile devices?

\subsection{\ac{HMM}-based Approach}
\label{subsec:hmmembedded}

An example of how speech synthesis can be implemented on embedded platform without deep learning (core paper~3).

\subsection{Deep Learning-based Approach}
\label{subsec:deepembedded}

An example of how speech synthesis can be implemented on embedded platform WITH deep learning (core paper 4).
