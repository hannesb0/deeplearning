\begin{abstract}
	In this paper I aim to give a systematic review about the impact of deep learning-based implementation of speech synthesis systems on resource restricted devices. First a brief introduction into \ac{SPSS} and its alternatives is given, then two approaches on how to improve \ac{SPSS} with deep learning models are presented. 
	%Therefore the performance and quality is compared to conventional systems.
