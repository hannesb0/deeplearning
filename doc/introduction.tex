\section{Introduction}

Virtual personal assistants (\acsu{VPA}) like Siri, Cortana or Google Now start having a huge impact on the way of interacting with electronic devices like smartphones. Up to now the \acp{VPA} help only with very simple tasks like search queries, starting phone calls or setting a clock, but according to a recent survey from the IT research firm Gartner~\cite{gartner:assistants}, this will change in the near future. With the Facebook Messenger it is already possible to make purchases and here new use cases are expected soon \cite{gartner:assistants}. To enable the almost natural speaking experience with such assistants both \ac{ASR} and speech synthesis are essential.

In this paper we will only focus on the speech synthesis part. The conventional technique to synthesize human speech from a given text or from linguistic descriptions is \ac{SPSS}; also referred to as \ac{SPSG}. This technique is based on the usage of \acp{HMM} and has several advantages over other existing approaches, like ...

However the conventional approach to synthesize human speech based on \acp{HMM} still delivers a muffled voice due to over-smoothing [stat]
