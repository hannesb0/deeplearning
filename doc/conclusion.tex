\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, a systematic review of the impact of deep learning models on speech synthesis on mobile devices is given. Therefore, different approaches to improve the conventional \ac{HMM}-based synthesis are pointed out, including the deployment of \acp{DNN} as acoustic models or in the parameter generation task. Here, a significant improvement of the prediction performance and the speech quality can be achieved \cite{zen:deepstatistical, hashimoto:effect}. In the following, the goal of modifying speech synthesis for the use in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices, is outlined by reference to two strategies: one with and one without the use of deep learning models. In the first one, the focus is set on adjusting different parameters and applying several optimization steps \cite{toth:optimizing} in order to achieve real-time playback. As a result, the computation time can be decreased by 65\,\% without a negligible loss of speech quality. The last approach \cite{boros:robust} tackles the dependency of network access, while using speech synthesis applications on mobile devices. Therefore the authors suggest the use of \acp{DNN} in several parts of the front-end of a \ac{TTS} system so as to reduce the footprint size, which enables the offline use of speech synthesis applications.

It is expected that the acceptance of \acp{VPA} like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa will increase in the near future \cite{gartner:assistants}. Therefore, the development of robust and resource-efficient speech synthesis methods is an essential part to meet the challenges of mobile environments. Innovative technologies like personalized speech-to-speech translation or voice cloning are only two examples of emerging techniques, wherefore speech synthesis has to be as evolved as possible~\cite{edinburgh:speech}. I~believe that the use of deep learning methods has the potential to accelerate future developments in the field of speech synthesis on mobile devices. Therefore, it is a worthwhile approach to further improve these methods both in terms of voice quality and efficient embedded implementation. % as part of a promising research direction in the future. % Thus, this topic is a promising research direction for the future.
