\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document. Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are used as examples only.
