To think about:
===============

- division of TTS system in front- and backend

- conclusion of section 4.2 (optimized HMM) -> if presented

- Version of functional diagram -> more basic & and only synthesis part ??

- What is a HMM? -> Deep Learning for Acoustic Modeling in Parametric Speech Generation: A systematic review of existing techniques and future trends

- What is auto encoder? -> if presented this paper

- Bring up MLPG (Maximum Likelyhood Parameter Generation)

- Bring up Decision Trees






Tips from Debayan:
==================

- not necessarily all content of paper in presentation
- citing in short format: Author (Title) Conference Year
- Scope: 15 - 20 slides
- not to filled and not to empty
  -> good looking
- overview picture of speech synthesis -> brief general introduction of TTS
- QA: acknowledge questions and be very polite
